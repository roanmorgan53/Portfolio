          Hi, my name is Roan Morgan. Since a very young age, I have always been
          interested in all things technology. Even more importantly, how
          technology influences our world. I first began on this tech focused
          journey in middle school. I had taken a class there called "Exploring
          Technology". This class consisted of basic html/css, arduino, and lego
          robotics. This sparked an ever-growing curiosity about tech that
          hasn't left me since. Now, I am currently a community college student
          in the central valley of California studying computer science. I hope
          to enter the field of tech and work on a project that will influence
          the physical world around us. May that be cars, trains, or planes who
          is to know.
