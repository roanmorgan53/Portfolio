          Hi, my name is Roan Morgan. Since a very young age, I have always been
          interested in all things technology. Even more importantly, how
          technology influences our world. I first began on this tech focused
          journey in middle school. I had taken a class there called "Exploring
          Technology". This class consisted of basic html/css, arduino, and lego
          robotics. This sparked an ever-growing curiosity about tech that
          hasn't left me since. I have continued to pursue and build on my
          interests in higher education. I hope to enter the field of tech and
          work on a project that will influence the physical world around us.

              C++ was my introduction to backend development through the
              computer science course at College of the Sequoias. This language
              sparked my interest in lower level languages, and ultimately
              having more control over the computer and its capabilities.

            When it comes to web design, this webpage is a showcase of my
              understanding of the fundamentals and basics of web design.
              However not prestine and refined, it is more than adequate for a
              simple portfolio. HTML/CSS was the first "programming" I had ever done,
              and it has stuck with me ever since.

              I do not have much experience when it comes to Python,
               but I have been actively pursuing small projects that have been slowly making me comfortable with it.
                As seen in the projects section, me and some classmates decided to work on a C compiler in Python.
                We did not complete this project, but it was a good lession in the basics of Python as well as project management and team work.

                This compiler was the final project for my Computer Architecture and Organization class. 
                Me and two others worked collaboratively on the project, with my role being lexical analysis.
                We set out to learn about how exactly a compiler works by making one ourselves. There were many takeaways from this
                project such as me becoming more familiar with Python, and learning about the inner workings of a compiler.
                In particular, I became more familiar with string analysis and the file stream.
