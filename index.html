      <p>
        Since a very young age, I have always been
        interested in all things technology. Even more importantly, how
        technology influences our world. I first began on this tech focused
        journey in middle school. I had taken a class there called "Exploring
        Technology". This class consisted of basic html/css, arduino, and lego
        robotics. This sparked an ever-growing curiosity about tech that
        hasn't left me since. I have continued to pursue and build on my
        interests in higher education. I hope to enter the field of tech and
        work on a project that will influence the physical world around us.

              C++ was my introduction to backend development through the
              computer science course at College of the Sequoias. My experience and comfort with the language continued
              to grow at the University of Tennessee.

              When it comes to web design, this webpage is a showcase of my
              understanding of the fundamentals and basics of web design.
              However not prestine and refined, it is more than adequate for a
              simple portfolio. HTML/CSS was the first "programming" I had ever done,
              and it has stuck with me ever since.

              My internship as a NSF REU Undergraduate Researcher included programming in python for data wrangling in
              order to evaluate machine learning models based on their precision, f1, and recall.

                This compiler was the final project for my Computer Architecture and Organization class.
                Me and two others worked collaboratively on the project, with my role being lexical analysis.
                We set out to learn about how exactly a compiler works by making one ourselves. There were many
                takeaways from this
                project such as me becoming more familiar with Python, and learning about the inner workings of a
                compiler.
                In particular, I became more familiar with string analysis and the file stream.
